# 30AlgorithmsDayChallenge
I set myself to a challenge of learning at least 1 algorithm for 30 days along with other friends.
With regionals coming up I wanted to take an initiative with my friends to learn new algorithms and take a small amount of time every day to program.

Update:
It was a fun challenge where in the end, I only lasted 18 days.
As the punishment for not completing this challenge, I had to decolor my hair and dye it to another color.
Since I decided to go wild with this, I opened a poll on fb and let the people choose the color and did indeed dye it to that color (gray).
